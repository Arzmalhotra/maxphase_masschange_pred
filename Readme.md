this project integrates machine laerning with material science to predict the mass change per unit area for different max phases based on certain properties
The features include max phase composition ,
lattice parameters	(a	b	c) ,
electronegativities of the elements (EN_a	EN_b	EN_c) ,
average electronegativity (	avg EN), 
cohesive energy (E_coh) , 
Valence electon concentration (VEC) , 
Interfacial enthalpy (midemma model based calculations)	del_h ,
melting temperatures (	Tm_a	Tm_b	Tm_c) ,
average melting pt (Tm_avg) ,
tempertaure and time
The codes would be uploaded once the review of this research paper has been completed
